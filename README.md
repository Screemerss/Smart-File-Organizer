# Smart File Organizer

A simple but powerful Python application to automatically organize files in a folder based on their extension. Keep your "Downloads" folder clean forever!


## ✨ Features

*   **Automatic Sorting**: Monitors a folder and moves files into subdirectories (`Images`, `Documents`, `Video`, etc.).
*   **Easy to Use**: Simple graphical interface built with Tkinter.
*   **Customizable**: Easily extend the file types by modifying the `FILE_TYPES` dictionary in the script.
*   **Safe**: Runs in the background without blocking the user interface.
