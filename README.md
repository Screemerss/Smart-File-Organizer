# Smart File Organizer

A simple but powerful Python application to automatically organize files in a folder based on their extension. Keep your "Downloads" folder clean forever!


## ✨ Features

*   **Automatic Sorting**: Monitors a folder and moves files into subdirectories (`Images`, `Documents`, `Video`, etc.).
*   **Easy to Use**: Simple graphical interface built with Tkinter.
*   **Customizable**: Easily extend the file types by modifying the `FILE_TYPES` dictionary in the script.
*   **Safe**: Runs in the background without blocking the user interface.

## 🗺️ Roadmap

I have a long-term vision for making this tool even smarter. Thanks to some great community feedback, here are some of the features I'm planning to explore for future versions:

*   **[v1.0]** - Basic sorting by file extension.
*   **[v1.1]** - Multi-language support (EN/IT) and custom icon.

### Planned for Future Releases

*   **[ ] Custom Rules Engine:** Allow users to create their own rules based on filename, creation date, or size.
    *   *Example: "Move all files containing 'invoice' to a 'Finances/Invoices' folder."*
*   **[ ] Metadata-Based Sorting:** Organize files using their internal metadata.
    *   *Example: "Group photos by the year and month they were taken."*
*   **[ ] Local AI Content Analysis (Long-term Goal):** The ultimate goal is to use privacy-friendly, offline AI models to understand the *content* of files.
    *   *Example: Automatically distinguish a vacation photo from a downloaded meme, or a tax form from a shopping list.*
